# Equity-Assistant
An assistant which may help you out before trading and show you some statistics related to it using Python3 and various libraries in it. Strictly for educational purpose, not to be implemented in the industry without consent. 

Equity Assistant helps you out to analyze the movement of the close prices of the next 60 days. The purpose of this project is to encourage new investors and beginners in stock market to get started without a doubt in their approach. It might also help the present and experienced investors to tally their actual calculations with the services provided by Equity Assistant.

The project is still under development and open to suggestions from novice and experienced developers. At this point, this project can take input through speech and do its own tasks of analysis. Few of the modules are quite temporary, i.e., they were implemented as a substitute to the failure of actual implementation or lack of approach in them. Equity Assistant has no GUI as such. It relies on <STDIN> and <STDOUT> for now but can be moulded into beautiful through a basic push button on a window or so. There is a lot of room for improvement. Till now either waiting time or performance has to be compenstated for better results.

I hope this helps for developers in various ways. This project is built with an intention to lay groundwork for these kind of projects. Keep Coding!
